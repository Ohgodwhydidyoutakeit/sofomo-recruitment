create app 
title, manifest, tests, typescript, solid principles, dotenv for api keys, session storage, scssnpm, do a better readme, github, maybe some pipelines 

wont add .env to gitignore since its a recruitment app 
also will probably mock the api since i hav only 100req/month

from what i gather or api uses only ip so if we want to have a url we need to first do a nslookup

we will use redux toolkit
